For this CI/CD pipeline project, Git and GitHub were used as the source code management(SCM) tool for CI(continuous integration). Jenkins was used as an automation server which played crucial role in CI/CD pipeline. Jenkins consisted of a JenkinsFile which included set of actions to be performed in the pipeline. Whenever there was a change in code, Jenkins detected it using Webhooks in GitHub and started triggering the jenkins pipeline. Webhooks were a way to receive automated notifications and updates that occured within a GitHub repository. Next step in the pipeline was building the application which was carried out using Maven. Mavenâ€™s role in the pipeline was to manage the build process and generate an executable Jar file. Going further, Sonarqube was used as a static code analysis tool that was integrated in CI/CD pipeline. The scanner in Sonarqube was used to for the testing purpose and analyse various code quality issues, security vulnerabilities and maintainability problems, and generate a report which can be viewed on the interface. Next step was using Docker to generate docker images which includes executable packages consisting of code, system tools, libraries, etc. These docker image was then pushed to DockerHub. The final step in CI/CD pipeline was to use Kubernetes for the deployment of the application.
